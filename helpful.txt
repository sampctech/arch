To refresh bash so you don not have to relaunch the terminal over & over when editing some files,
    source ~/.bashrc

I found that the bash-personal file that comes with ArcoLinux is very nice.
I am finding it to be but can be hard to memorize & a good bit of the shortcuts I have not found usefull yet.
Because of this, so I'm creating my own.
Once I figured out how to create my own aliases file, I added a reference to the .bashrc file.
I listed those steps below so you can modify mine or create your own as well.

# Alias definitions.
# It's a good idea to put all your additions into a separate file like aliases or personal
# instead of adding them directly to the .bashrc file. This will keep from loosing them
# after an update that could rewrite the .bashrc file itself
# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.
# Uncomment the following to reference
# for aliases
# [[ -f ~/.bashrc_aliases ]] && . ~/.bashrc_aliases
# for personal
# [[ -f ~/.bashrc-personal ]] && . ~/.bashrc-personal

How to Change BASH Prompt Color

\e[0;32m[\u@\h \W]\$\e[0m

Here’s a breakdown of the commands:

• \e[ – Begin color changes
• 0;32m – Specify the color code
• [\u@\h \W]\$ – This is the code for your normal BASH prompt (username@hostname Workingdirectory $)
• \e[0m – Exit color-change mod

The first number in the color code specifies the typeface:

• 0 – Normal
• 1 – Bold (bright)
• 2 – Dim
• 4 – Underlined

The second number indicates the color you want:

• 30 – Black
• 31 – Red
• 32 – Green
• 33 – Brown
• 34 – Blue
• 35 – Purple
• 36 – Cyan
• 37 – Light gray

Additionally, if you combine the bright option with a color code, you get a lighter version of that color. For example, if you use color code 1;32, you would get light green instead of the normal green. If you use 1;33, you get yellow instead of brown.

Cinnamon

Personally I'm a fan of Cinnamon so I'm gonna tackle that first.
As I proceed, I will add others as I try them.
Check the corisponding files with those steps as I go about trying & writing them out.

So that this is done & I have a good starting point to work from, I 
I am going to install xorg then make my copies form this image.
For xorg prompts I am going with defaults & installing all options
I also found that this is a good time to start adding some "essentials"
To make life a little easier, here I also install nano, git, wget & bash-completion
bash-completion completes commands when you press on TAB. This will make life eaier going forward
    sudo pacman -S xorg-server xorg-apps xorg-xinit xterm git wget bash-completion termite neofetch


Here is a good plac to setup our AUR yelpers.
I'm starting with just yay for now.
To install yay we need to do the following:
Clone the yay git repository
Change the file permissions from the root the sudo user.
Build the package using the makepkg command

$ cd /opt
$ sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-git.git
$ sudo chown -R NAME:users ./yay-git
$ cd yay-git
$ makepkg -si

Lastly we need to update yay
$ yay -Syu

To include development packages during the upgrade:
$ yay -Syu --devel --timeupdate

See Packs doc for more yay info
